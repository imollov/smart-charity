# Requirement

Main goal of this project is to support more direct, accountable and transparent ways of giving to charitable causes.

In many cases, these rely on the creation of automated and tamper-resistant ‘escrows’ where donations are held with a third party, before they are released or returned based on predefined rules and conditions.

Instead of relying on intermediaries we can create a smart contract that enables 'programmable donations'.

Each charity campaign author will have to define:

- Purpose
- Story
- Target amount
- Start date
- End date

The campaign starts accepting donations of any size after the start date and stops after the end date is due or the target amount is fulfilled.

Additionally for greater transparency the author must provide a breakdown of how the funds are going to be used by specifying a list of beneficiaries:

- Official name
- Reason
- Amount required
- Address of account

If a change is required to the list above - an amendment request is made available to all donors, including the following:

- Beneficiary record to be removed from the list
- Beneficiary record to be added to the list
- Start date
- End date

The requested change is applied if more than 50% of the donors approve. Donors who do not manage to vote in the specified time frame will automatically approve the change.

After the end date is passed the collected funds are made available to claim from all beneficiaries if the target amount is fulfilled or sent back to the donors if the opposite is true.
